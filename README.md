# pandoc-slides

**This is for Mac OS X**
I just pulled together some information on how to easily create slides from markdown.

## Prerequisites

It needs to have [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html) and npm installed and available.  

## Usage

* git clone this
* cd pandoc-slides
* make install
* subl . (or whatever editor you're using now)
* (edit the example habits.md)
* make revealjs

## Todo

still didn't get pandoc to use the theme
